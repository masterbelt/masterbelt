# tree-sitter-masterbelt

The [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) grammar for the masterbelt
language. It opens the editors that require tree-sitter — Zed, Neovim, Helix,
Emacs (treesit), and GitHub's web highlighting — for which a TextMate grammar
does not suffice.

## How it is built (single source, no second lexer)

masterbelt does not hand-maintain a second parser. The grammar is split so the
lexer truth has exactly one home:

- **`lexical.js` is generated** by `toolchain/internal/editorgen` from
  `pkg/source/token` — the same source the VS Code TextMate grammar is
  generated from. It carries the keyword table, operator spellings, comment
  markers, and literal regexes. **Do not edit it.**
- **`grammar.js` is hand-written.** It `require`s `lexical.js` and builds the
  structural rules (declarations, expressions, statements) on top. The
  structural layer is tree-sitter's own; it is kept honest against the real
  parser by the CST snapshot test (C-2 plan §3), not by being generated.
- **`src/` is generated** by `tree-sitter generate` from `grammar.js`. The
  generated `src/parser.c` is committed so consumers (editors) need no
  tree-sitter CLI — only this repo's developers do.

## Regenerating

From the repo root:

```sh
make generate          # runs editorgen (lexical.js) then tree-sitter generate (src/)
make verify-generated  # fails if the committed output is stale
```

`tree-sitter generate` needs the tree-sitter CLI; it is pinned as this
package's `devDependency` (`npm ci` here installs it). The C-2 plan's §5
records this as the one new development dependency.
